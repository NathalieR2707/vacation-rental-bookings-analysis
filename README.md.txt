- Demonstrate data storytelling and client-facing analysis
- Provide a walkthrough of exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset

### Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks

### File Structure:
- `data/`: raw Airbnb listings data
- `notebooks/`: main exploratory notebook
- `assets/`: charts and figures
